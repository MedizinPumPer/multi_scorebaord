Planing:
Use multiple sports in one scoreboard like "NHL, NFL, Bundesliga, Prem. League, Handball, ...".

- to work as stand-alone with Ras-Pi and matrix display
- to work as stand-alone with WLED to use more displays 
- gets an own webinterface to set-up teams and leagues
- 

Everyone is invited to build on that project.
